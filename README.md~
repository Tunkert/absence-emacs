# Absence Emacs

## Requirements

This init.el specifies the Jetbrains-Mono font, which is downloadable for free here:
[Jetbrains Mono font](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

You'll also need to run "M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts" once installed to get the modeline to look right

## Installation

Back up and move your .emacs.d and then run the following command from the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tunkert/absence-emacs ~/.emacs.d
```
